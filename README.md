# DealMate

DealMate is an open-source project that helps users save money by finding and applying publicly available coupon codes during online checkout.

The project is designed with the following principles:

- No ads
- No tracking
- No affiliate injection by default
- No sale of user data
- No circumvention of website protections
- No behavior a normal user could not perform manually

The browser extension only runs when explicitly triggered by the user and behaves in a rate-limited, human-like way to remain compliant with merchant systems and applicable laws.

## Project Structure

- `extension/` — Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox; Edge and Opera later)
- `backend/` — Minimal coupon API and storage
- `website/` — Public-facing informational website
- `docs/` — Documentation and design notes

## Status

This project is in early development. Functionality, APIs, and supported sites will evolve over time.

This project will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
